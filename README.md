# War-Game_GOAP-AI

About the project: 

This game was part of our Final Year Project. The game makes use of Goal-Oriented Action Planning to define enemy behvaiors that are realistic and complicated. Conventionally there were a number of methodologies employed to provide the Non-Player Characters (NPCs) with decision-making such as simple if-else statements, behavior trees, finite-state machines etc. However, the resulted behavior was far too simple to be categorized as human behavior. In recent times, these conventional methods have been replaced by AI techniques to come up with intelligent NPCs behaviors. One of these AI techniques is known as Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP), developed by Jeff Orkin, and has been used in some of the best known games such as F.E.A.R (Monolith Productions), Fallout 3 (Bethesda Softworks), Just Cause 2 (Avalanche Studios) etc. In this project, we have applied GOAP to generate NPCs behaviors that are believable so that the users may experience an environment which is not too different from real life. All game mechanics, sounds, graphics and animations were made from scratch.

Game features:

* GOAP AI to dictate the AI characters' behaviors.
* AI character's path navigation via A* Pathfinding to adjust to the changing surroundings.
* Smooth camera control with mouse.
* A dialogue box system for providing instructions.
* Unique character animation through animating each limb separately.
